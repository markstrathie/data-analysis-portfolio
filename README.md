**Lettuce_Growth_Days**  
*Dec 2023*
- what factors can improve lettuce growth rate?
- a small data analysis project using MS Excel. Part of my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate
- I combined 2 .csv datasets into lettuce_EDA.xlsx
- formatted the data and took an initial look. I then wrote a scope of work for the project SOW.docx
- aggregated the data into table of 70 plant with avg values recorded to compare growth rates
- performed exploratory data analysis to find correlations
- bivariate analysis showed slight correlations between temperate and humidity with growth rate
- bivariate analysis showed slightly stronger correlations between TDS and pH level with growth rate
- produced visualisations using Excel in form of 4 scatter plots with trendlines
